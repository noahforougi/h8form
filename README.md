# Comparing Commercial Banks using Federal Reserve H.8. Form Data

### Project Description
This project is still a work in progress. In this project, I present a detailed report on assets and liabilities across 5 different types of commercial banks in the US, using data sourced from the Federal Reserve H.8. Form Website. There will be an interactive Shiny Dashboard, as well as an automated report that will be updated with every release. Moreover, all the data will combined with historical data to provide a long term look at the trends in these balance sheet statistics.
